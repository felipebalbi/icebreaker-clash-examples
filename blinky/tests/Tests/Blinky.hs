Unit test for "Blinky".

Blinky has no data inputs (it is a pure clock divider), so there is nothing to
property-test with random stimulus the way the upstream orangecrab @blink@
example does. Instead we check the one observable behaviour deterministically:
driven for several short periods, the LED output actually toggles.

Because the circuit /is/ a function from the (empty) input stream to an output
stream, we test it with plain Haskell — 'sampleN' the output and count
transitions. No simulator, no testbench harness.

{- | Sample @n@ cycles of the LED output with a tiny 4-bit counter (so the MSB
toggles every @2 ^ 3 = 8@ cycles and a handful of periods fit in @n@). The
circuit is run in Clash's default 'C.System' domain; its @resetGen@ holds
the counter at 0 for the first cycle, after which it free-runs.
